NAME

  wp login

DESCRIPTION

  Manage magic passwordless sign-in.

SYNOPSIS

  wp login <command>

SUBCOMMANDS

  create          Create a magic sign-in link for the given user.
  email           Email a magic sign-in link to the given user.
  install         Install/update the companion server plugin.
  invalidate      Invalidate any existing magic links.
  toggle          Toggle the active state of the companion server plugin.

```

### `create` / `as`

```
wp login create <user> [options]
```
or alternatively use the alias
```
wp login as <user> [options]
```

Create a magic sign-in link for the given user.  Outputs the created URL with some extra information for the user regarding usage and expiration.  URLs expire 15 minutes after creation ([configurable](#--expiresseconds)), or at the time of use, whichever comes first.

> `<user>` can be passed as an User ID, username/login or email address. This is the same for all `login` commands which accept this as a parameter.

#### `--expires=<seconds>`

Set the lifetime of the magic link in seconds.

    10 minutes = 600  
    1 hour     = 3600  
    1 day      = 86400

Default: `900` (15 minutes)


#### `--url-only`

Outputs the created sign-in URL only. Great for scripting, piping to your clipboard, or anything else you can think of.

#### `--launch`

Launches the sign-in link your default browser immediately after creation.  This is the fastest possible way to login.

### `email`

```
wp login email <user> [options]
```

Email a magic sign-in link to the given user.  Sends a nice HTML email to the user's email address containing their freshly created magic sign-in link.  Planning to add support for both HTML and plain text emails in the future.

#### `--expires=<seconds>`

[See above.](#--expiresseconds)

#### `--subject=<email-subject>`

Optionally override the default email subject with your own custom string. You may use the `{{ domain }}` placeholder.

Default: Magic log-in link for {{domain}}

#### `--template=<path-to-custom-template>`

Optionally override the default email template with your own by providing the path to a different template file to use.
The email template is compiled using the Mustache template engine, so you may use the `{{ magic_url }}` and `{{ domain }}` placeholders in your custom template.  The default template can be found in this repository under `template/email-default.mustache`.

### `install`

```
wp login install [options]
```

Install/update the companion server plugin.  Installing the companion plugin is required before magic links will work on the host.
The `login` command is aware of the installed version of the plugin, and will inform you if it needs to be installed, activated or upgraded.
If the plugin is already installed, you will be prompted to overwrite it.

#### `--activate`

Optionally activate the plugin immediately after installation.

#### `--yes`

Suppress prompting for confirmation to overwrite the existing plugin.

> Using a Composer-based WordPress install? You can require the companion plugin using the package `aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-login-server`.

### `invalidate`

```
wp login invalidate
```

Invalidate any existing magic sign-in links.  Any previously created links will most likely go to a 404 page.

### `toggle`

```
wp login toggle [<on|off>]
```

Toggles the active status of the companion plugin.  Optionally pass `on` or `off` to set the activation accordingly. Without it, the status is simply inverted.
